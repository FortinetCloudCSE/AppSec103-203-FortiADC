### Adaptive Learning - Configuration 

The configuration steps will be as follows:

1. Create an Adaptive Learning Profile 
2. Create a WAF Profile and add the Adaptive Learning Profile created in step 1
3. Associate the WAF Profile with the Virtual Server created in the "Initial Configuration" section of the lab. 



### Step 1 - Create an Adaptive Learning Profile
* Login to the FortiADC (FAD-Primary) with the username ```xperts2025``` and password ```AppSec-Xp3rts2025!```
* Go to **Web Application FireWall** â†’ **Adaptive Learning**
* Click on **+Create New**

* Status: **Enable** the toggle
* Sampling Rate: ```100```
* False Positive Threshold: ```100000```
* Learning Time: ```1```
* Click **Save**

* Name: ```DVWA```
* Status: **Enable** the toggle
* Sampling Rate: ```100```
* False Positive Threshold: ```100000```
* Learning Time: ```1```
* Click **Save**
