### Adaptive Learning - Configuration 

The configuration steps will be as follows:

1. Create Adaptive learning profile 
2. Create WAF profile and add the Adaptive learning profile created in step 1
3. Associate the WAF profile with the virtual server created in Section one of the lab. 



### Step 1 - Create Adaptive learning profile
* Access Primary FortiADC's GUI from the console using the link provided
* Login to the FortiADC with the username ```xperts2025``` and password ```AppSec-Xp3rts2025!```
