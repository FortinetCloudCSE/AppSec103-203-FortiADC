### **FortiADC Security modules**
FortiADC provides comprehensive security modules, divided into four main categories:

- **Network Security**: This includes Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Antivirus (AV), and IP address-based rules.
- **Application Security**: Focuses on Web Application Firewall (WAF), including API protection and API gateway capabilities.
- **Bot Mitigation**: Detects and mitigates traffic originating from automated sources.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Mitigation**: Provides protection against DoS attacks.


In this exercise, we will focus on Application Security. The other sections will be covered in future discussions.
